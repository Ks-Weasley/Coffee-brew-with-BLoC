# COFFEE BREW CREW

Coffee brew with Bloc State Management

## Summary of my work

This project is inspired from [@iamshaunjp](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-firebase).<br>
The original idea uses Provider for State Management. However, my piece of work uses **BLoC State Management**.<br>
This project illustrates how to use the **Firestore realtime database**.

## Dependencies 
- [BLoC State Management](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore/versions/0.7.1)
